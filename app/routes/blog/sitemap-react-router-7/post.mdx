If you’re building a website or web application, you’ll want to make sure your site is discoverable by search engines. One essential step is providing a [sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview) that lists all your public routes.

<Alert type="question" heading="Why automate your sitemap?">
  Manually maintaining a sitemap is tedious and error-prone. By generating it
  from your route definitions, you ensure it’s always up-to-date and accurate.
</Alert>

## Prerequisites

- A project using **React Router 7** or **Remix.run**.
- Your have access to your route definitions via for example `virtual:react-router/server-build` or `virtual:remix/server-build`.

## Step 1: Install the Required Package

First, you need to install the <ProfileBadge platform="GitHub" handle="forge-42/seo-tools">@forge42/seo-tools</ProfileBadge> package. This library provides utilities for handling SEO-related tasks and has a dedicated `@forge42/seo-tools/remix` export that works with Remix.run and React Router 7 applications.

```bash
npm install @forge42/seo-tools
```

## Step 2: Create the Sitemap Loader

Create a file at `app/routes/sitemap.xml.ts`. This file will export a `loader` that generates the sitemap on demand:

```typescript filename="app/routes/sitemap.xml.ts" showLineNumbers
import { generateRemixSitemap } from "@forge42/seo-tools/remix/sitemap";
import type { Route } from "./+types/sitemap.xml";
import { href } from "react-router";

export const loader = async ({ request }: Route.LoaderArgs) => {
  const { routes } = await import("virtual:react-router/server-build");
  const { origin } = new URL(request.url);
  const sitemap = await generateRemixSitemap({
    domain: origin,
    ignore: [href("/api/chat"), href("/legal-notice"), href("/privacy-policy")],
    // @ts-expect-error Type mismatch, maybe related to a stricter type mentioned in release notes for v.7.0.0
    // https://github.com/forge-42/seo-tools/issues/8
    routes,
  });

  return new Response(sitemap, {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/xml",
    },
  });
};
```

### What’s happening here?

<NewsletterForm />

1.  We dynamically import the `virtual:react-router/server-build` to get our route definitions.
    <Alert type="info">
      Since [React Router
      v7.4.0](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v740)
      the `virtual:react-router/server-build` module is type safe and we can
      destructure our `routes` object from it.
    </Alert>
1.  **`generateRemixSitemap(){:ts}`**: This helper function takes your route definitions and creates a valid sitemap.
    <Alert type="info">
      Because the package is build for Remix v2, the function automatically
      looks for routes in `virtual:remix/server-build`, but with React Router 7,
      the correct module would be `virtual:react-router/server-build`. That’s
      why we have to import the `routes` in the previous step by hand. I already
      [opened an issue](https://github.com/forge-42/seo-tools/issues/13) to get
      native support for React Router 7.
    </Alert>
1.  **`ignore`**: Excludes routes you don’t want indexed (like API endpoints or legal pages).

    <Alert type="question" heading="Why ignore some routes?">
      Not every route should be indexed by search engines. Exclude API
      endpoints, admin pages, or anything private.
    </Alert>

    I prefer using the `href(){:ts}` function from React Router 7 to ensure the paths are correct.

    <Alert type="tip">
      The `href` function was introduced in [React Router
      v7.2.0](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v720)
      and ensures type safety for your links.
    </Alert>

1.  **`domain`**: This specifies the domain to append the urls to. I used the request’s `origin`, so it works in any environment.
1.  **Response**: Returns the sitemap as an XML response with the correct content type.

## Step 3: Register the Route

Make sure the route is included in your route config:

```typescript filename="app/routes.ts"
export default [
  // ...
  route("sitemap.xml", "routes/sitemap.xml.ts"),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

Now, visiting `/sitemap.xml` in your browser will return a fresh, up-to-date sitemap!

<Alert type="warning" heading="Douplicate Route Registration">
  When using the package I came across an issue where the home route (`/`) was
  registered multiple times in the sitemap. I already [opened an
  issue](https://github.com/forge-42/seo-tools/issues/12) to address this.
</Alert>

## Step 4: Test Your Sitemap

Visit `/sitemap.xml` in your browser or use an [online validator](https://www.mysitemapgenerator.com/service/check.html) to check that your sitemap is valid and includes all the right routes.

## Step 5: Submit to Search Engines

If you want your sitemap to be indexed by search engines, you need to submit it. Most search engines will automatically discover it if you link to it from your `robots.txt`, but submitting it directly is more reliable.

Once you have your sitemap, submit it to search engines like Google and Bing:

- For Google, use the [Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/sitemaps).
- For Bing, use the [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/sitemaps).

## ⚠️ Vite Build Issue

If you’re using React Router 7 with Vite, you might run into a build error related to the virtual module import path. This happens because `@forge42/seo-tools` tries to import `virtual:remix/server-build` by default, but in React Router 7 projects, the correct module is `virtual:react-router/server-build`.

This mismatch can cause your Vite (or Rollup) build to fail with a module resolution error like:

```
Rollup failed to resolve import "virtual:remix/server-build" from .../@forge42+seo-tools....
```

### The Fix: Add the remix virtual module as an external dependency

As a temporary workaround, add the following to your `vite.config.ts` to tell Vite/Rollup to treat the old virtual module as an external dependency:

```ts filename="vite.config.ts"
import type { UserConfig } from "vite";

export default {
  // ...
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      external: ["virtual:remix/server-build"],
    },
  } satisfies UserConfig,
};
```

This will unblock your build until the package adds official support for React Router 7’s new module path.

## Conclusion

Generating a sitemap in React Router 7 or Remix.run is straightforward when you leverage your existing route definitions and a tool like `@forge42/seo-tools`. This approach saves time, reduces errors, and helps your site stay SEO-friendly.

For more information and advanced usage, check out the [official documentation](https://github.com/forge-42/seo-tools) for the package.

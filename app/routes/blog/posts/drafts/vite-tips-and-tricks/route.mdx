[Vite](https://vite.dev/) has been my go-to build tool for almost every web project over the past few years. While its opinionated defaults make setup straightforward, there are some plugins and configurations I found quite useful, which can enhance ones development workflow and productivity.

## What is Vite?

Vite is a next-generation frontend build tool that aims to provide a faster and more streamlined development experience for modern web projects. It is used by [most modern web frameworks](https://vite.dev/#frameworks-section) and libraries under the hood and [powers some of the most popular websites around the world](https://github.com/vitejs/companies-using-vite).   
To learn more about Vite and it's features check out the [official documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

## Development Tips

### Automatically open the browser on app start

You can automatically open the browser when you start your Vite development server by adding the following configuration to your `vite.config.js` file:

```ts filename="vite.config.ts"
export default {
  server: {
    open: true,
  },
};
```

### enable server host for all network interfaces by adding the following configuration:

This is useful for testing your application for mobile devices or other devices on your local network:

```ts filename="vite.config.ts"
export default {
  server: {
    host: true,
  },
};
```

## Useful plugins

### vite-tsconfig-paths

<del>Since there is no built-in support for TypeScript path mapping</del>, you can use the `vite-tsconfig-paths` plugin to automatically resolve paths based on your `tsconfig.json` file.

Here is how path aliases can be easily setup:

```json filename="tsconfig.json" highlight={3-6}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./app/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

```ts filename="vite.config.ts" showLineNumbers highlight={2,5}
import type { UserConfig } from "vite";
import tsconfigPaths from "vite-tsconfig-paths";

export default ({
  plugins: [tsconfigPaths()],
}) satisfies UserConfig;
```

```tsx filename="app/routes/example.tsx" showLineNumbers highlight={1}
import Button from "@/components/ui/Button";

export default function Example() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}
```

<Alert type="success" heading="Native support for TypeScript path mapping">
 With [`rolldown-vite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rolldown-vite) there is now native support for TypeScript path aliases. For an implementation example, check out the [following commit for this website](https://github.com/nikolailehbrink/portfolio/commit/78be087b66ff6bc0f20959faa6d4eac40799303a).

### vite-plugin-inspect

### vite-plugin-devtools-json

Are you using Chrome and tired of seeing the following error in your console?

```plaintext
No routes matched location "/.well-known/appspecific/com.chrome.devtools.json"
```
[`vite-plugin-devtools-json`](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/vite-plugin-devtools-json) can help you out and generates the `com.chrome.devtools.json` route on the fly in the dev server.
